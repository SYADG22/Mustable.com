\section{Problems}
Firstly, this system being proposed here will try to solve the issue of time management by us students and maybe the lectures too.
This is in the sense that, most of the student here at MUST we most of the time go to class and wait for the lecturer to come and waste like 30 minutes or so only to find out that there is no class. Though it may look like a minor problem but the time wasted here can be used for other activities by students which requires earlier notices. 
\\
\\
On top of that, there is an issue of unutilized time on the time table. Some courses have their time tables with multiple gaps in it. So, with the system, these time slots may be put to good use.


\section{Proposed solution/ Objective}
On the issue of time management by students, the LAMS will solve this problem by allowing lecturers to update their statuses in the system where it will show if the lecturer is on campus or out. So, us students will see these statuses and if the lecturer is not in, we shouldn't bother going to class. 
"What if the lecture is in but not coming?"
This question is leading us to the second problem that the LAMS will try to solve, that is unutilized time on the time table. So, in the system there will be a time table where the lecturer will update that he is coming on this period or not. And the time table will indicate free slots so that the lecture can move a class to one of those spots.
If a lecturer has indicated that he/she is not coming on a certain period the system will still show that as a free slot so that other lecturers can move up their time.
\\
\\
All in all, this system is just trying to put all the time allocated to each course to maximum use.
